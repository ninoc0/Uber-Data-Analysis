# Uber Data Analysis

This is my first project in R. Its purpose is to demonstrate the analytical abilities of R. 

Taking public Uber data from the months April to September, we can create models of their most busy days. To find the models, check out the *issues*.

The first graphic output shows how many rides are ordered per hour. This data can be used to fluxuate prices. In hours where less cars are ordered(such as 1-5), prices should be lowered in order to drive up demand. Inversely, the prices for hours where more cars are ordered(such as 15-20), prices should be rised in order to yield greater profit and lower demand to meet the supply. 

The second graph shows the same data, but divides it by month. Instead of having aggregated totals, we can get a more specific output in order to decide prices.
